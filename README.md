# Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository works as a database for the data structures and algorithms I have studied and implemented in Java.

I will be using this repository for future projects and leetcode practice.

## Data Structures

- [ArrayList](https://github.com/Tales-Andrade/algorithms-and-data-structures-implementations/tree/main/data-structures/ArrayList)

- [Single Linked List](https://github.com/Tales-Andrade/algorithms-and-data-structures-implementations/tree/main/data-structures/SingleLinkedList)

- Double Linked List
